# JAVA

So, when I was studying at College of Southern Maryland, my CS courses would have required the use of the book "Starting Out With JAVA: From Control Structures through Data Structures, 3rd Edition" by Tony Gaddis and Godfrey Muganda.

Some of my posts here will be direct assignments given from the book, and those will be noted. 

Some others will just be my own projects. 

Coming soon.
